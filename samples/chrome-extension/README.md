# ConfigCat Sample Chrome Extension

To try this sample, load this folder as an unpacked extension.

1. Go to the Extensions page by entering chrome://extensions in a new tab.
2. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to **Developer mode**.
3. Click the **Load unpacked** button and select the extension directory.

For the sake of simplicity, this extension uses only the copied build output of the SDK. (`script/configcat.js`)
